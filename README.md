# Roller-Madness
I have developed level 1 of the game with the help of the Coursera course and then added further levels myself with enhancements. In this game, the enemy follows the player and the player has to defend himself from being hit by the enemy along with collecting coins to win the level if the player gets hit he dies. When every level changes no. of enemies and coins also increases.
