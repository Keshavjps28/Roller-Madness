# Roller-Madness
I have made the level1 of the game from scratch with the help of course from Coursera and then Added a Level2 and so on myself with some Enhancement.
In this game the enemy follow the player and player has to defend itself from hitting to the enemy if it get hit the player died and the player has to also collect the coin to win the current level and to move on to the another level and it is on , wheb every level changes enemy increases , collection of number of coin increases and Madness also increases.
